# Snoopy
I have created this application for Homework 2 assignment 

Following is its description
An app built from scratch containing skeletal features like User Registration, Authentication, Login and upload and store content. Storage provided by Firebase. Watch this space for the directions this app will take!!

Project was created step by step on android studio and has been tested on an emulator. 

Modules:

1) User Registration
2) User Login
3) User Profile
4) Select and Upload Images
5) Process Progress Dialogs 
6) Upload Progress dialogs

The name: 
I am and have always been an avid reader of Detective tales, ghoulish and suspensful short stories of the like of Ruskin Bond and even Legends of Sleepy Hollow culminating with Sherlock Holmes. I intend to make this app into a space where users can register and submit their own creations (short stories) of this genre and also art related to such genre created or found by them! Hence the name Snoopy!! An unseemly name considering the theme of the app!
